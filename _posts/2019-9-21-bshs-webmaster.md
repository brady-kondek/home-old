### <u>About</u>

This website is a project for the TSA event Webmaster.  In this event, you are to make a website that focuses on an overview of your TSA Chapter.  You are also to make another site that follows the theme for the year, which is known as the Design Brief.

### <u>Competiiton</u>

This site will be used for competition purposes at the 2020 Region 3 Pennsylvania TSA Conference in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.  If it does well there, it will move on to the Pennsylvania State competition at Seven Springs Mountain Resort in Champion, Pennsylvania.  If it places there, it will move on to the final location, the National Competition, which will be held in Nashville, Tenessee in June.
