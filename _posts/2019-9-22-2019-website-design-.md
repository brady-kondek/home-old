## <u>About</u>

This website is a project for the TSA event Website Design. In this event, you are to make a website that follows a theme.  During the time when this site was made, the theme was Escape Rooms.  The website had to be a realistic site for an escape room company.


## <u>Competition</u>

This website won first place at the Region 3 Pennsylvania TSA conference in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on February 2nd, 2019.  It moved on to states, April 10th - April 13th, at Seven Springs Mountain Resort in Champion, Pennsylvania.  Sadly it did not place there.
