##  <u>About Me</u>

I have been making websites since 2015.  Up until June 2017, all I knew how to make was a simple Wix/Weebly site.  But, then at that time I taught myself DNS and HTML/PHP.  Through learning those things, I have been able to create amazing projects and continue to do so every day!

## <u>Stuff I Make</u>

I make all sorts of things.  I have made game websites, batch coded programs, file storage websites, picture gallery websites, and lots more!

## <u>My First Website</u>

The first website I ever made was a Wix site for a club my friends and I made, called The Star Wars Club.  It was basically like any other website for a club.  I made this site in Decemeber 2016.

## <u>ESBN Enterprises</u>

In May 2017, me and three other people made a "company" called ESBN Enterprises.  It was originally a site that would produce fun online/downloadable stuff, which would all be put on the website.  Then in October 2018, it was switched over to a web-hosting company providing WordPress hosting, which was run off of a WordPress multi-site network that I made.  ESBN sort of exists now, we just don't really dedicate much time to it anymore.

## <u>The Future</u>

I am always learning and making new things every day.  I plan to continue to make lots of more websites, and like to make them cooler every time I make a new one.  One of the goals I have set for myself is to make a stunning website completely made from scratch coded in HTML and CSS.
